This is a Demo Project for my talk (in Italian) at the GDG Mediterranean DevFest 2014, see http://www.gdgnebrodi.info/eventi/prossimi-eventi/google-devfest-mediterranean-2014/

To run it, go to pom.xml's directory and run *mvn spring-boot:run*, then, in your browser, open *http://localhost:8080*.
If you want to see the HAL Browser, go to *http://localhost:8080/hal-browser/browser.html*.

The talk was about Spring Boot & AngularJS, with a focus on HATEOAS paradigm and HAL specification.
This project is very basic and built for the talk purposes, so don't expect in-depth analysis ;)
